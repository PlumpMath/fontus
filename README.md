**_Spring MVC &amp; jqGrid: a CRUD application template_**



This project is a template of a CRUD web application that uses Spring Web MVC (a Java web framework) and jqGrid (a JavaScript grid UI component). Why is it called Fontus? In ancient Roman religion, Fontus was a god of wells and springs.

You can check this web application online at http://demo.alexey.cloudbees.net (login: **admin**, password: **admin** for access to the protected pages). The page usually opens from the second attempt as the server hibernates the application when it is not used.
